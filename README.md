# Tic Tac Toe AI (Minimax)

This project is based on the CS50 AI Tic-Tac-Toe assignment.

- `runner.py` and the project structure were provided by CS50.
- `tictactoe.py` contains my own implementation of the game logic and the Minimax algorithm.

The AI uses recursive minimax search to choose optimal moves.
